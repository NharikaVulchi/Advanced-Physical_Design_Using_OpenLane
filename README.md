1. Chip is the IC of the board, all the on-board pins are interfaced with the processing unit.
2. PADS are the interface between the signals which mvoe into and outside the chip
3. Core of the chip is Digital Logic Unit where the digital instructions are performed.
4. The chip design is fabricated on silicon, this is called a die

1. A sample RISC-V SoC is shown in the below figure.
2. PLL, ADC, SRAM's on the chip are the foundry IPs(Intellectual property)
3. macros are the digital units
